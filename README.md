# PAGAI_AI

I've created the initial Python script for your Hiring Assistant chatbot. This includes:

A Streamlit interface with fields for candidate details and a chat-like interaction section.
Backend integration with OpenAI's GPT-based language model for generating tailored technical questions.
Basic conversation flow handling, including a fallback response and a graceful exit mechanism.

Steps to Run the Chatbot:
Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal and install the required Python libraries:

**pip install streamlit openai**

Save the Code: Save the provided code in a file named chatbot.py.
Run the Streamlit Application: Navigate to the directory where chatbot.py is saved, then run:

**streamlit run chatbot.py**

Interact with the Chatbot: Once the server starts, it will open a new browser tab where you can interact with the chatbot.
